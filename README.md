# IGListKitTest
IGListKit 第三方套件測試與使用  
IGListKit is a data-driven UICollectionView framework built by the team at Instagram.  
With this framework, you provide an array of objects to display in the UICollectionView.  
For each type of object an adapter creates something called a section controller,  
which has all of the details for creating cells.
